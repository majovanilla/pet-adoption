# React Capstone Project - Pet Finder

> This project is part of the Microverse React curriculum.
The purpose of the project is to create an app that connects to an API and renders the information for the user, allowing them to filter it.
I created this app thinking about something that could be useful in real life and help people.
That's why I connnected with an API that helps people find pets to adopt.
The app renders a list of pets and the user can filter them by type, gender, size, and age.
When you click on the name of the pet, you can see the detailed information about the animal and how to adopt it (contact information).npm
